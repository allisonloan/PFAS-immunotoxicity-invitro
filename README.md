# PFAS-immunotoxicity-invitro
PBMCs from human donors exposused to varying concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA,PFDA, PFHxS, and GenX followied by exposure to LPS or PHA. 

PBMC maintenance
Purified PBMCs from 8 healthy adult donors (4 males and 4 females) were sourced from a commercial supplier (Miltenyi Biotec, USA, cat#150-000-572). Along with the PBMCs, corresponding plasma samples were also provided for baseline PFAS analysis. Upon arrival, PBMCs were aliquoted in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Millipore Sigma, cat#472301) and 90% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher, cat#A5256701) and stored at -80°C for future analysis. Corresponding plasma samples were also stored at -80°C for future analysis.
For analysis cryopreserved human PBMCs were rapidly thawed in a 37°C water bath and resuspended in FBS. 5000 U/mL Micrococcal Nuclease (Thermo Fisher, cat#EN0181) was added for 20s followed by 5 mL of FBS. The cells were then resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher, cat#11875093) supplemented with and 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, cat#15140122). Cell number and viability was assessed using trypan blue. 

CFSE (Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) staining 
After thawing, cells were resuspended in 1 µM CFSE (Thermo Fisher, cat#C34554) solution and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. Following staining, cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1×106 cells/mL and left to rest overnight at 37°C.

Flow cytometry 
	Single cell suspensions were stained with LIVE/DEAD fixable aqua dead cell stain in PBS (1:1000, ThermoFisher, cat# L34957) to exclude dead cells and debris, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. To block non-specific binding of antibodies by Fc receptors, prior to staining for surface antigens cell were incubated with Mouse BD Fc Block (1:100, BD, cat#553141 ). Suspensions were then incubated with antibodies CD3 Monoclonal Antibody, APC (ThermoFisher cat#17-0037-42), CD4 Monoclonal Antibody, eFluor™ 450 (ThermoFisher cat#48-0049-42), and IFN gamma Monoclonal Antibody, PE (ThermoFisher cat#12-7319-42) in flow cytometry Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences, cat#554715). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) running FACSDiva acquisition software , and data analyzed using FlowJo v10.
 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays (ELISAs)
Human IFN-gamma DuoSet ELISA (Bio-Techne, cat#DY285B) and Human TNF-alpha DuoSet ELISA (Bio-Techne, cat#DY210) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For cytokine analysis PBMC supernatant isolated 24 h post PFAS exposure were diluted 1:2 in reagent dilutent.
